Now I want to discuss with you some important Project Discussion are you raedy?
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely 🚀 I’m ready. Tell me about your project discussion — what’s the context and what areas you’d like to focus on? Architecture, design choices, tech stack, implementation details, or something else?

You said:
Now we have an existing project called Docs Classification service. Now currently it is classifying the documents to a certain type. So we are currently using Gemini Flash to upload the scanned pdf or the normal PDFs to the Gemini. So along with that we are sending prompt and instructions to classify the documents based on those instructions. And the prompt is having all documennt tuples, Description and a prompt to classify it accordingly.
ChatGPT said:

Got it ✅ — let me reflect back what I understood:

You have a Docs Classification Service.

The service ingests PDFs (scanned or normal).

The PDFs are sent to Gemini Flash (likely using the multimodal API).

Along with the document, you send a prompt + instructions that contain:

Possible document types (tuples).

Descriptions of those document types.

A classification prompt telling Gemini to assign the right type.

Gemini responds with the classification.

So right now it’s prompt-driven classification using Gemini.

Before I dive deeper — do you want this discussion to focus more on:

Architecture improvements (scalability, modularity, error handling, vector DB, RAG, hybrid classification).

Model approach (fine-tuning vs. zero-shot, embeddings + similarity search, confidence scoring).

System-level concerns (cost, latency, monitoring, fallback strategies).

Future roadmap (agentic workflows, explainability, human-in-the-loop).

Which angle do you want me to explore first for your project?

You said:
Now one more thing is there. We are maintaining a vector store which will save the summary of the document getting from Gemini and doc id also. This process a seperate one. We are using this as Evaluation technique to verify. Now that is using semantic search to get the response from vector DB and then we are comparing the result coming in the previous discussion which we had. Now we want to introduce again an another evalutation technique as E2. In this one my idea is that I wan to use Triplets(Subject,Object, Predicate). I want to extract all the Subject,Object,Predicate from the documents summary getting from Gemini. And I want save this one in another Vector Db and Want to do the 2nd Evaluation. 
ChatGPT said:

Perfect 👌 this is becoming a multi-layered evaluation framework for your Docs Classification service. Let me break down what you have now and where your E2 idea fits in:

📌 Current Setup (Evaluation E1)

Docs Classification Service classifies a PDF using Gemini Flash + prompt.

You also extract summary from Gemini.

You store (doc_id, summary) in a Vector DB.

Evaluation technique (E1) = semantic similarity check

Run a query → retrieve semantically similar docs → compare with classification result.

📌 Your New Idea (Evaluation E2 with Triplets)

After you generate summary from Gemini:

Extract knowledge triplets (Subject–Predicate–Object) → like (Invoice, hasDate, 2025-09-20)

Store these triplets in a second Vector DB (or in a graph DB like Neo4j for richer reasoning).

For evaluation, instead of text similarity, you do semantic / relational search on triplets.

Compare whether the classification is consistent with factual relations extracted from the doc.

✅ Benefits of E2 (Triplet-Based Evaluation)

More structured: avoids noise from long summaries.

Explainability: you can say “this document was classified as Invoice because it contains (Invoice → hasTotalAmount → $1000)”.

Cross-checking: can run logical consistency checks (e.g., if Subject=Bank Statement, but triplets show (Invoice → hasTaxID), classification may be wrong).

Extensibility: later you can add rule-based validation, ontologies, or even reasoning with LLMs on triplets.

🔧 How You Could Implement E2

Triplet Extraction

Use Gemini or another IE (information extraction) model to generate triplets from the summary.

Example prompt:
“Extract all meaningful subject–predicate–object triplets from the following summary. Format as JSON: [{subject:.., predicate:.., object:..}]”

Storage

Option 1: Store embeddings of triplets in Vector DB (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS).

Option 2: Store structured triplets in Graph DB (e.g., Neo4j, AWS Neptune) → best if you want reasoning.

Evaluation Querying

When you evaluate a doc classification:

Retrieve related triplets from Vector DB/Graph DB.

Check if those triplets align with expected attributes of that doc type.
Example: Invoice must have (Invoice, hasAmount, X) and (Invoice, issuedBy, Y).

Scoring / Comparison

Define a metric: % of expected triplets present vs. missing.

Or run a secondary LLM evaluation using GEval →
“Based on the following extracted triplets, is the classification ‘Invoice’ correct?”

👉 This way, you’ll have two independent evaluations:

E1 (Semantic search on summaries) → general semantic validation.

E2 (Triplet-based evaluation) → structural, factual validation.

Would you like me to draw a sequence/architecture diagram for how E1 + E2 fit together in your pipeline?

You said:
You are correct but one thing. I want to use E2 to get the document type or document code from Vector DB when I pass an another Triplets as my query.
ChatGPT said:

Ahh ✅ got it — thanks for clarifying.
So in E2 you’re not just evaluating but actually retrieving the document type (or code) using triplets as the query.

Let me restate the flow in my own words:

📌 Your E2 Goal

You extract triplets (Subject, Predicate, Object) from each document summary (via Gemini).

Store those triplets in a Vector DB (embedding space).

Later, when you provide another set of triplets as a query → system retrieves the closest matching stored triplets.

From the retrieved triplets, you map back to doc_id → doc_type (or code).

🛠️ How to Design E2 (Triplet → DocType Retrieval)

Triplet Extraction (from doc summary)

Prompt Gemini to extract structured triplets.

Example format:

[
  {"subject": "Invoice", "predicate": "hasAmount", "object": "1000 USD"},
  {"subject": "Invoice", "predicate": "issuedBy", "object": "ABC Corp"}
]


Triplet Representation for Vector DB

Convert each triplet into a string form:

"Invoice hasAmount 1000 USD"
"Invoice issuedBy ABC Corp"


Embed these strings with your embedding model (Gemini embeddings, or open models like text-embedding-3-large).

Store in Vector DB along with metadata:

{
  "embedding": [ ... ],
  "doc_id": "1234",
  "doc_type": "Invoice",
  "triplet": "Invoice issuedBy ABC Corp"
}


Querying with Triplets

User/system provides a triplet query, e.g.
"Invoice issuedBy ABC Corp"

Embed the query triplet.

Run similarity search against the vector DB.

Retrieving Document Type

Get top-k matching triplets.

From metadata → resolve doc_id and doc_type.

Return doc_type (or document code).

🔑 Example Flow

Store triplets for doc_id D101:

Triplet: "Bank Statement hasAccountNumber 1234"
Triplet: "Bank Statement issuedBy Wells Fargo"
doc_type: "Bank Statement"


Later query with:

"Bank Statement issuedBy Wells Fargo"


Vector DB returns top result → doc_id D101 → doc_type Bank Statement.

✅ Advantages

Much more structured than raw summaries.

Can support query by fact instead of by free text.

Enables hybrid: combine E1 (summary semantic search) and E2 (triplet matching) → then use voting/weighting to finalize doc_type.

👉 Do you want me to design a combined architecture diagram showing how your Docs Classification Service integrates:

Document ingestion → Classification → Summary store (E1) → Triplet store (E2) → Query & Retrieval of DocType?

You said:
You are almost correct but one correction. Mostly data which we are going to extract Triplets shouldn't be on any name or any address. It should be like a common nouns. 
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 28s

Perfect — thanks for the clarification. I'll assume triplets must use common nouns / generic categories (no raw person names, addresses, or other direct PII). Below I’ll give a practical, end-to-end plan you can adopt immediately: prompts, normalization rules, PII handling, storage schema, retrieval flow, scoring, and trade-offs.

Key constraint

All extracted triplet tokens must be generic/common-noun or category tokens (e.g., payer, recipient, company, store, invoice, amount, date, account-number), not proper names, full addresses, or direct identifiers.

Design decisions (high level)

Extract with LLM (Gemini) but instruct it to mask/abstract PII at generation time.

Run an automated PII/NER filter to ensure no names/addresses slip through; replace with category placeholders (or hashed tokens if you must link to raw data securely elsewhere).

Normalize triplets into a canonical vocabulary (lowercase, lemmatize, fixed predicate names).

Embed the normalized triplet string and store embedding + metadata in a Vector DB for E2 retrieval.

At query time, normalize the query triplet the same way, embed, search, and aggregate results to propose doc_type/doc_code.

Concrete prompt templates

Triplet extraction prompt (force common nouns / categories)

You are an information-extraction assistant.
Input: a document summary.
Task: extract meaningful Subject-Predicate-Object triplets.

Rules:
1. Replace any PERSON/ORG/LOCATION/ADDRESS/PHONE/EMAIL with generic category tokens:
   - Person -> "person"
   - Organization -> "organization"
   - Address -> "location"
   - Bank account -> "account-number"
   - Email -> "email"
   - Phone -> "phone"
2. Replace numeric values with category tokens where appropriate:
   - Amounts -> "<AMOUNT>"
   - Dates -> "<DATE>"
   - Invoice numbers -> "<INVOICE_NO>"
   - Account numbers -> "<ACCOUNT_NO>"
3. Use only common nouns or category tokens in subject/object. Do not output names, full addresses, or raw PII.
4. Output JSON array: [{"subject":"...", "predicate":"...", "object":"..."}]

Example output:
[
  {"subject":"invoice", "predicate":"has_amount", "object":"<AMOUNT>"},
  {"subject":"invoice", "predicate":"issued_by", "object":"organization"},
  {"subject":"payment", "predicate":"date", "object":"<DATE>"}
]


Prompt to force categorical mapping (if raw named entity exists)

If the summary contains "ACME Corp" or "John Doe", map to "organization" or "person". If the entity is a retailer/merchant, map to "merchant".

PII detection & masking (recommended pipeline)

Run an NER model (spaCy, transformers NER) on summary to detect PERSON/ORG/LOC/ADDRESS/EMAIL/PHONE/ID tokens.

Replace each detected PII span with the category token described above.

Optionally: store the mapping {masked_token: hashed_original} in a secure, access-controlled DB if you need traceability. Never store raw PII in vector DB.

Feed masked summary to LLM extraction or do the extraction then post-mask and verify.

Normalization rules (apply BEFORE embedding)

Lowercase everything.

Lemmatize nouns & verbs (invoice → invoice, issued → issue).

Use canonical predicate names: has_amount, issued_by, invoice_number, date, account_number, total, due_date, payment_method, etc.

Collapse synonyms via a mapping, e.g., total_amount, amount_due → has_amount.

Replace numbers/currencies/dates with <AMOUNT>, <DATE>, <NUMBER> tokens.

Remove stop words from predicates; keep meaningful tokens.

Trim excessive detail; keep subject as a common noun or category.

Triplet representation for embedding & storage

Store both structured and canonical string forms:

triplet_text (canonical string for embedding):
"invoice has_amount <AMOUNT>"

triplet_struct: {"subject":"invoice","predicate":"has_amount","object":"<AMOUNT>"}

doc_id: original doc id

doc_type: label/code (e.g., INVOICE, BANK_STATEMENT)

hash_id (optional): hashed pointer to raw PII mapping stored securely

embedding: vector

pii_masked: true

Example record (JSON):

{
 "triplet_text": "invoice issued_by organization",
 "triplet_struct": {"subject":"invoice","predicate":"issued_by","object":"organization"},
 "doc_id": "DOC_1234",
 "doc_type": "INVOICE",
 "embedding": [...],
 "pii_masked": true
}

Embedding strategy

Embed the canonical triplet_text (subject + predicate + object) as a single string. This preserves relational context and tends to work better for similarity search than embedding each element separately.

Optionally create a document-level signature vector by averaging or aggregating embeddings of important triplets for faster doc-type retrieval.

Query processing (triplet → doc_type)

Normalize the input query triplet using the same pipeline (mask names → map to categories → canonicalize).

Create query_text and embed.

Search top-k triplets in vector DB.

Aggregate results by doc_id or doc_type:

Sum similarity scores per doc_type → choose highest-scoring doc_type.

Or vote by top-k hits: majority wins.

Apply confidence threshold: if max_score < T, return unknown or fallback to E1 or an LLM classifier.

Scoring / metric ideas

Top-1 accuracy: does retrieved doc_type match ground-truth.

MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank): for ranking quality.

Precision/Recall on triplet presence: how many expected triplets for a doc type are found.

Confidence calibration: map similarity score to probability using validation set.

Trade-offs & risks

Pros: more structured, explainable, fewer privacy risks (if masked properly), better for rule checks.

Cons: masking names/addresses removes discriminative tokens that sometimes matter (e.g., specific vendor names distinguishing doc types). Mitigation: map to entity categories (merchant_type, supplier_type) instead of fully erasing semantics.

OCR errors: add OCR confidence checks / fuzzy matching / spell-correct before extraction.

Over-generalization: too generic triplets might cause collisions (different doc types look same). Mitigation: include extra normalized attributes (predicates like has_template_field_X) or combine E1+E2 voting.

Practical examples

Raw summary

"John Doe paid $1,200 on 2025-09-01 to ACME Corp for invoice #INV-100."

Masking → masked summary

"person paid <AMOUNT> on <DATE> to organization for invoice <INVOICE_NO>."

Triplets (after LLM extraction)

[
  {"subject":"payment", "predicate":"amount", "object":"<AMOUNT>"},
  {"subject":"payment", "predicate":"date", "object":"<DATE>"},
  {"subject":"invoice", "predicate":"invoice_number", "object":"<INVOICE_NO>"},
  {"subject":"invoice", "predicate":"issued_to", "object":"organization"}
]


Triplet text (for embedding)

"payment amount <AMOUNT>"

"invoice issued_to organization"

Implementation checklist (quick)

 Build/verify NER + PII masking step.

 Create canonical vocabulary & normalization functions.

 LLM triplet extraction prompt & JSON parsing.

 Triplet-to-embedding + vector DB schema (with pii_masked flag).

 Query-time normalization + embedding + aggregation logic.

 Validation dataset to tune similarity threshold and scoring.

 Monitoring/alerts for PII leakage (scan stored triplet_text periodically).

Next practical help I can give right now

Provide ready-to-use Gemini prompts tuned to your summaries (I already gave a base — I can refine for your doc domain).

Generate normalization code snippets (Python) for NER masking + canonicalization.

Sketch an architecture diagram or a sequence diagram for the E1+E2 pipeline.

Produce sample unit tests for triplet normalization and retrieval logic.

Which of those would you like me to produce first — a refined extraction prompt for your domain, or the Python normalization + masking code?

You said:
You understood all the things before jumping to the project. I need some clarification here.
ChatGPT said:

Got it 👍 let’s pause before diving into the build.
Go ahead with your clarifications — what exactly would you like me to clear up? Is it about:

Triplet extraction rules (how to enforce common nouns & avoid PII leakage)?

Storage design (Vector DB vs Graph DB for triplets)?

Query flow (how a new triplet query maps back to doc_type)?

Evaluation vs Retrieval (where E2 fits in your pipeline)?

Integration with existing E1 (semantic search on summaries)?

Which part feels fuzzy for you right now?

You said:
Now I want to use Deepeval framework. Where can I fit this in this flow and what are the benefits I'm going to get.
ChatGPT said:

Great question 🔥 — bringing Deepeval into this flow can give you a standardized, automated way to evaluate your classification + retrieval system, instead of relying on ad-hoc checks. Let’s map it.

📌 Where Deepeval Fits in Your Flow
1. E1 Evaluation (Semantic Search on Summaries)

Already you compare summary retrieval vs classification output.

Deepeval can formalize this with metrics like:

ContextualPrecisionMetric

ContextualRecallMetric

ContextualRelevancyMetric

GEval for correctness

Example:

Input = query

Expected output = doc_type ground truth

Actual output = doc_type returned from semantic search

Metric → Did the semantic search produce the correct doc_type?

2. E2 Evaluation (Triplet → DocType Retrieval)

After you query with a triplet and retrieve a doc_type/code:

Input = triplet query (e.g., "invoice has_amount <AMOUNT>")

Expected output = true doc_type (e.g., "Invoice")

Actual output = retrieved doc_type from Vector DB

Deepeval metrics → correctness, faithfulness, coverage

Extra twist: you can also evaluate the triplet extraction step itself:

Compare extracted triplets vs. gold-standard annotated triplets.

Deepeval’s GEval can check “Did the extracted triplets capture the correct relationships from the doc summary?”

3. End-to-End Evaluation (E1 + E2 Combined)

Define Deepeval test cases that represent the whole pipeline:
Given a PDF, does the final classification (after semantic + triplet retrieval) match the ground truth doc_type/code?

This lets you compare E1-only vs. E2-only vs. Hybrid performance.

✅ Benefits of Using Deepeval Here

Standardized Metrics

No need to handcraft scoring logic for semantic/structural matching.

You get precision, recall, relevancy, and correctness metrics out-of-the-box.

Custom Criteria

You can define evaluation criteria like:

“Does the retrieved doc_type align with the majority of triplets?”

“Are all mandatory triplets for this doc_type present?”

Regression Testing

Add Deepeval test cases to CI/CD → every model/prompt change can be tested against a gold set of docs.

Multi-Model Comparisons

Try Gemini vs OpenAI vs Llama for triplet extraction, and use the same Deepeval suite to see which performs better.

Explainability in Reports

Deepeval gives detailed breakdowns → you’ll know why a failure happened (missing context, wrong doc_type, incomplete triplet).

📂 Where to Hook It

Triplet extraction stage → eval triplets vs expected.

Classification stage (E1) → eval doc_type correctness from semantic summaries.

Classification stage (E2) → eval doc_type correctness from triplet-based retrieval.

Final decision stage → eval hybrid decision.

Basically, Deepeval wraps around evaluation checkpoints at each stage.

👉 Question for you:
Do you want Deepeval here to be used only for offline evaluation (model/pipeline testing), or also as part of the live service (e.g., real-time self-evaluation to monitor quality drift)?

You said:
That's an interesteing question. we need the live service aswell.
ChatGPT said:

Perfect 👍 since you need a live service (not just offline evaluation), Deepeval can fit in two complementary layers:

🔹 Where to fit Deepeval

Offline (Batch Evaluation / Training Feedback Loop)

After classifying docs with Gemini Flash (E1) and Triplets (E2), you run Deepeval metrics on:

Contextual Relevancy (is the retrieved doc type actually relevant to the query?).

Precision/Recall/F1 (how many correct document types were captured).

Faithfulness (is the classification grounded in the provided summary/triplets?).

This is more like QA for your pipeline and helps fine-tune prompts, retrieval strategy, and triplet extraction rules.

Online (Live Evaluation in Service)

Wrap Deepeval in your microservice as a monitoring component.

For each live classification request, store the outputs and periodically run Deepeval checks on sampled traffic.

Example:

User uploads doc → Gemini Flash classifies (E1) → E2 validates via triplets.

Deepeval compares the retrieval match vs ground truth (if available) or applies consistency checks across E1 & E2.

Alerts if drift / degradation is detected.

🔹 Benefits You’ll Get

✅ Consistency Scoring → measure how often E1 & E2 agree, or if one is drifting.
✅ Bias / PII Guardrails → triplet extraction avoids names/addresses, Deepeval can validate that outputs don’t leak sensitive fields.
✅ Metric-driven Improvement → you’ll know if summary-based retrieval (E1) is weaker than triplet-based retrieval (E2).
✅ Feedback Loop for LLM → poor cases can be auto-collected for prompt/embedding fine-tuning.
✅ Production Readiness → you can show stakeholders not just “it works” but “it works reliably with X% precision/recall”.

👉 So the flow would look like:

Upload Doc → Gemini Flash Summary → (E1) Semantic Search → (E2) Triplet Search → Classification Result → Deepeval Metrics (offline + sampled live requests).

Would you like me to sketch a pipeline diagram showing how E1, E2, and Deepeval (offline + live) connect together?

You said:
Now I don't want to use develop first 3 steps.
ChatGPT said:

Ah, got it ✅ — you want to skip the first three steps (PDF ingestion → Gemini summary → E1 semantic search) and focus only on the triplet-based retrieval + live evaluation (E2 + Deepeval).

Here’s how the simplified pipeline would look:

🔹 Simplified Flow (Focus on E2 + Deepeval Live Evaluation)

Triplet Extraction from Documents

Input: PDF or existing text summary.

Extract structured triplets (subject, predicate, object) using Gemini (or any IE model).

Ensure masking/normalization: only common nouns or generic categories; no PII.

Store Triplets in Vector DB

Embed canonicalized triplet strings.

Save metadata: doc_id, doc_type (or document code), triplet_text, embedding.

Query Triplet → Retrieve Document Type

Input: new triplet query (normalized & canonicalized).

Embed query and search vector DB for closest matches.

Aggregate top-k results → determine doc_type or document code.

Live Evaluation using Deepeval

Wrap retrieval output in Deepeval test case:

input = query triplet

expected_output = true doc_type

actual_output = retrieved doc_type from Vector DB

Metric: GEval or ContextualPrecisionMetric to measure correctness.

Run live or sampled traffic evaluation to monitor retrieval accuracy.

Optionally log failed cases for model/pipeline improvement.

🔹 Benefits of This Simplified Approach

No need to maintain summaries or do semantic search (E1).

Triplet-based retrieval directly maps queries to doc_type → faster, structured, explainable.

Deepeval metrics ensure real-time monitoring of retrieval correctness.

Easier to enforce PII masking and normalization, since you only deal with triplets.

Lightweight pipeline → easier to scale, maintain, and debug.

If you want, I can draw a clear live service architecture diagram for this E2 + Deepeval-only flow, showing vector DB, triplet query, retrieval, and live metrics monitoring.

Do you want me to do that next?

You said:
You are correct. This is going to be a POC project. So Instead of PDF. we are going to give the summary only.
ChatGPT said:

Perfect ✅ — that makes the POC much simpler and lets you focus purely on the triplet-based retrieval + live evaluation.

Here’s how your POC pipeline would look:

🔹 POC Flow (Summary → Triplets → Retrieval → Deepeval)

Input Summary

Instead of PDFs, you feed document summaries directly.

Example:
"Payment of $1200 was made by ACME Corp on 2025-09-01 for invoice #INV-100."

Triplet Extraction

Use Gemini (or any LLM) to extract Subject-Predicate-Object triplets.

Apply masking and normalization rules:

Replace names/organizations/dates/amounts with generic tokens: organization, <AMOUNT>, <DATE>.

Keep only common nouns and generic categories.

Example output (canonical triplets):

[
  {"subject":"invoice", "predicate":"has_amount", "object":"<AMOUNT>"},
  {"subject":"invoice", "predicate":"issued_to", "object":"organization"},
  {"subject":"payment", "predicate":"date", "object":"<DATE>"}
]


Store Triplets in Vector DB

Embed canonical triplet strings: "invoice has_amount <AMOUNT>".

Metadata:

doc_id (unique for this summary)

doc_type (e.g., "INVOICE")

triplet_text

embedding

Optional: pii_masked: True.

Query Triplet → Retrieve Document Type

Input: a query triplet (also normalized).
Example: "invoice issued_to organization".

Embed and perform similarity search in vector DB.

Aggregate results → return doc_type or code.

Live Evaluation with Deepeval

Wrap retrieval in Deepeval test case:

input = query triplet

expected_output = true doc_type

actual_output = retrieved doc_type from Vector DB

Metric = GEval or ContextualPrecisionMetric

Run on live/sampled POC queries to monitor retrieval accuracy.

Log failures → use for future prompt or triplet improvement.

🔹 Benefits for POC

Minimal pipeline → easy to implement and test.

Focus entirely on triplet quality and retrieval correctness.

Deepeval gives real-time evaluation and metrics without extra infrastructure.

Abstracts away PDF ingestion / OCR / semantic search → reduces complexity.

Lays foundation for future full pipeline with PDFs and E1 semantic search.

If you want, I can draft a concrete Python POC structure for this flow using:

Gemini for triplet extraction

FAISS / Weaviate for vector DB

Deepeval for live evaluation

That way you can start coding immediately.

Do you want me to do that next?

You said:
Great. Now first give me the project structure and ReadME file. Be more modular and follow all SOLID principles and Clean code architecture.
ChatGPT said:

Perfect! Since this is a POC project focusing on summary → triplets → vector DB → retrieval → Deepeval evaluation, we can design a modular, clean architecture in Python. I’ll also provide a detailed README explaining each module, usage, and evaluation flow.

You said:
Dont' mention doc classification instead mention summary classfication and I need data aswell for all the summaries and different types of documents and document codes aswell.
ChatGPT said:

Perfect ✅ — we’ll adjust the project to focus on Summary Classification instead of Doc Classification, and I’ll also provide sample summary data with document types and document codes for your POC.

🔹 Updated README.md (Summary Classification POC)
# Summary Classification POC (Triplet-Based Retrieval + Deepeval)

## Project Overview
This proof-of-concept project performs **summary classification** using **triplet-based retrieval** and **live evaluation** with Deepeval.  
Instead of full PDFs, the system works with **document summaries**. Triplets are extracted from summaries, stored in a **vector database**, and used to **retrieve summary types and codes**. Deepeval provides **real-time evaluation metrics** to monitor retrieval correctness.

## Architecture



Summary Input → Triplet Extraction → Triplet Normalization → Vector DB Storage
↓
Triplet Query → Embedding → Vector Search
↓
Retrieved Summary Type & Doc Code → Deepeval Evaluation


---

## Features
- Triplet extraction from summaries using Gemini Flash
- PII masking & normalization (common nouns only)
- Vector DB storage and retrieval
- Live evaluation using Deepeval
- Modular architecture following **SOLID principles** and clean code practices

Retrieve summary type & doc code

Evaluate correctness via Deepeval

Testing

Run all unit tests:

pytest tests/

Future Improvements

Integrate full PDF ingestion & OCR

Combine semantic summary search (E1) with triplet retrieval (E2) for hybrid evaluation

Fine-tune triplet extraction prompts for domain-specific accuracy

Add confidence scoring & threshold-based classification fallback


---

If you want, the **next step** I can do is **write a ready-to-run `main.py` POC** that:  

1. Loads sample summaries  
2. Extracts triplets via Gemini  
3. Normalizes/masks triplets  
4. Stores in Vector DB  
5. Queries a triplet  
6. Returns `summary_type` and `doc_code`  
7. Evaluates via Deepeval  

Do you want me to prepare that next?

You said:
Thank you very much. Now I'm gonna take help of your brother github copilot.and will do the work in sVS code.
ChatGPT said:

Awesome! 😎 That’s a perfect plan — GitHub Copilot + VS Code will make writing the modular Python POC much faster, especially with all the services, triplet handling, and Deepeval integration.

A few tips before you start coding:

Environment Setup

Make sure .env is configured with your Gemini API key and Vector DB key.

Use a virtual environment in VS Code for clean dependency management.

Copilot Productivity

Prompt Copilot with class/function docstrings — it will generate structured code matching your SOLID/clean architecture.

Use Copilot to generate unit tests alongside your modules.

Testing Frequently

As you code each module (triplet extraction, normalization, vector store, retrieval, Deepeval), run small tests to catch issues early.

Deepeval Integration

Start with simple GEval or ContextualPrecisionMetric on a few sample queries, then expand to live evaluation.

Logging & Monitoring

Use the logging utility I suggested to see live outputs as you build, especially when integrating Deepeval metrics.

If you want, once you start, I can help you generate Copilot-ready docstrings and scaffolds for each module, so you can literally just accept Copilot suggestions and have everything wired up properly.

Do you want me to prepare that next?

You said:
I forgot one thing. I want to use CrewAI for agentic development.
ChatGPT said:

Ah, perfect — adding CrewAI changes the workflow slightly because you can now orchestrate agentic tasks, rather than just sequential function calls. Essentially, CrewAI can act as a controller/agent that:

Takes summary inputs

Decides which sub-agent to call:

Triplet extraction agent (via Gemini)

Vector DB storage agent

Triplet query/retrieval agent

Deepeval evaluation agent

Handles decision-making, retries, or conditional logic if any step fails

Can operate in live service mode, orchestrating calls dynamically

Benefits of using CrewAI

Autonomous Orchestration

No need to call each module manually. CrewAI can dynamically chain steps.

Agentic Decision Logic

Can handle errors: e.g., if triplet extraction fails, retries or calls fallback prompts.

Can decide which evaluation metric to apply based on the query type.

Live Monitoring & Reporting

CrewAI can log outputs at each stage, run Deepeval evaluations automatically, and report real-time metrics.

Future Scalability

Later, you can add new agents (e.g., semantic search / E1 evaluation) without changing existing code.

CrewAI handles orchestration and decision-making.

🔹 Integration Suggestion

Keep your modular Python structure (services, db, models) as-is.

Add CrewAI orchestrator module in src/agents/crew_ai_agent.py:

Receives summary input

Calls each service module as a sub-agent

Handles retries, logging, and Deepeval evaluation

Returns final summary type & doc code with confidence metrics

If you want, I can update the project structure + README to include CrewAI and also prepare a CrewAI agent scaffold ready for VS Code + Copilot so your POC is fully agentic from the start.

Do you want me to do that next?

You said:
Please update the Readme file 
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely! Here’s the updated README reflecting Summary Classification POC with CrewAI for agentic orchestration, while keeping the modular, SOLID-based structure and sample data.

- Provides **sample data**  
- Explains **live evaluation via Deepeval**  

---

If you want, I can **also draft the `crew_ai_agent.py` scaffold** next, fully modular and Copilot-friendly, so you can start coding immediately.  

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
Have you included Deepeval aswell.?
ChatGPT said:

Yes ✅ — the README explicitly mentions Deepeval in multiple places:

Project Overview

“Deepeval provides real-time evaluation metrics to monitor retrieval correctness.”

Architecture Diagram

[CrewAI Orchestrator Agent] 
      │
      ├──> Deepeval Evaluation Agent (Live Metrics)


Usage Section

print("Evaluation Metrics:", result['metrics'])


This implies Deepeval runs as part of the CrewAI agent workflow and returns evaluation metrics along with the summary type and document code.

Features Section

Live evaluation using Deepeval is explicitly listed.

So Deepeval is fully integrated in the agentic POC workflow, both conceptually and in the usage example.

If you want, I can also show exactly how the Deepeval agent module (evaluation_service.py) would interact with CrewAI in the code scaffold — that way it’s ready to run. Do you want me to do that next?

Give me some summary on Ammendment
ChatGPT said:

Got it 👍 — here’s a short summary on “Amendment” in a general sense (not tied to any one country’s law):

Amendment – Summary

Definition: An amendment is a formal change, modification, or addition made to a law, legal document, contract, constitution, or agreement.

Purpose:

To correct errors or omissions.

To update or modernize provisions.

To add new rules or remove outdated ones.

Examples:

Constitutional Amendment – Changes in a nation’s constitution (e.g., U.S. Constitution amendments).

Contract Amendment – Adjustments in a business or employment contract without replacing the entire document.

Legislative Amendment – Modifications made to bills or laws while they are being debated or after enactment.

Key Features:

Legally binding once adopted.

Requires approval via a formal process (e.g., voting, signatures, parliamentary procedures).

Becomes an integral part of the original document.
